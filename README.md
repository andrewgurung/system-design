## Scalability
- Clones:
	- Clone is an exact replica of a codebase. Image files can be made from one server and new instances/clones can be produced
	- Useful in load balancing where a user Steve can login at server1. Then the other request can be served by some other available servers like server2, server3 or server4
	- Scalability Rule: Never store session information in local disc or memory. Otherwise Steve must always be served by server1
	- Sessions should be stored in a central external database or caches that are close to application server
- Databases
	- Path 1: Hire a DBA and tell him to do Master-Slave replication. Slave is for read-only, Master is for write-only. Add more RAM to Master server for performance. In the long run, it is better to go with Path 2
	- Path 2: Redesign your application to not use JOINS. Either stay with MySQL or switch to scalable NoSQL database like MongoDB. When the application gets slower due to your app doing all the dataset joins, it's time to introduce cache
- Caches
	- Cache is a simple key-value store that sits as a buffer between application and data store. Cache are lightning fast
	- Always opt for in-memory cache like Redis. Never do file-based cache, it makes cloning and scaling a pain
	- User sessions should always be cached
	- There are two patterns of caching data
		- Cached Database Queries: The resulset is stored in cache where the hashed query acts as key. Has issues with expiration and complex query. If a column is added to a table, all queries that uses that table has to be deleted.
		- Cached Objects: Better option where data is treated as an object. When the application has completed assembling the data, it can be directly stored in cache. The application just consumes the latest cached object and nearly never touches the databases anymore
- Asynchronism
	- Asynchronism is useful to avoid the user waiting for a service. While the requested service is being processed, user can navigate to other pages on the website
	- A messaging system like RabbitMQ can take a queue of task that a worker can process
	- There are two ways asynchronism can be done:
		- Async 1: Process time-consuming task in advance and serve the finished work in low request time. Eg convert dynamic site content to static. Results in a super responsive website
		- Async 2: When a very consuming task is requested, the job is added to queue and frontend immediately notifies the user that the task will take some time, please continue to browse the page. When the job is finished, the messaging system notifies the frontend to handle the response.

## High-level trade-off
### Performance vs scalability
### Latency vs throughput
### Availability vs consistency
